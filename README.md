- highlight excellent workshops and those that need improvement
- reminders for the next set of mentors when they are planning their week

## Middleware ðŸ–•

* **cookie-parser**: deals with cookies - creates them in the correct format
* **express-validator**: simplifies validation functions - checks length, email etc.
* **flash**: displays messages onscreen, e.g. error messages and confirmations
* **express-session**: manages session and setting cookie. *It works well with passport*
* **passport**: manages logins. *Use* `passport-local` *to deal with local DB sign-ups*
